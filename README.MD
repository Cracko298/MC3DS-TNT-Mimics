## Highly Experimental Mod
- TNT Mimics, are exactly what you think they are.
- It's a mob that Mimics TNT and takes some inspiration from the Shulker.
- For right now, it replaces the Shulker, however this will change in due time.

- Highly aggressive towards all mobs, and yes that includes the TNT Block.
- "Can" Teleport (By teleport I mean twitch randomly)
- Shoots Fire
- Exploads
- Drops new Item (TNT Shrapnel).
